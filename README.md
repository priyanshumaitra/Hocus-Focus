# HocusFocus

## ðŸ“ƒ Overview

We are building HocusFocus, a flow State Guardian app. The problem we're addressing is the constant struggle with digital distractionsâ€”like social media, notifications, and wandering attentionâ€”which makes it hard for people to maintain deep focus and productivity. Many existing tools block websites but donâ€™t help users understand or improve their focus. Our goal is to create a system that monitors attention and provides real-time feedback and actionable insights to help users achieve and sustain a flow state.

## ðŸ”® Features

**We plan to expand Hocus-Focus with the following features:**

- Real-time eye-tracking to monitor user focus and attention.
- Browser extension for distraction detection and focus score.
- An analytics dashboard visualizes focus sessions and distraction patterns.
- Clean, accessible UI for easy session management and progress tracking.
- Personalized focus recommendations based on user behavior.
